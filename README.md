# Asynchronous JavaScript Concepts

This repository explores essential concepts related to asynchronous JavaScript, focusing on the following key areas:

## Callbacks

Callbacks provide a mechanism to work with asynchronous operations. In JavaScript, they are functions passed as arguments to other functions, executed after the completion of an asynchronous task.

## Promises

Promises offer a cleaner approach to handling asynchronous code. They represent values that may be available now, in the future, or never. Promises help simplify asynchronous workflows and error handling.

## Promise.all

`Promise.all` is a method that allows handling multiple promises concurrently. It returns a single promise that resolves when all input promises have resolved, or rejects if any of them reject.

## Async/Await

The `async/await` syntax is a modern way to write asynchronous code with a more synchronous appearance. It simplifies the process of working with promises and improves code readability.

Explore this repository to gain insights into these asynchronous JavaScript concepts and enhance your understanding of handling asynchronous operations effectively.
